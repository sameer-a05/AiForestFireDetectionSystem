# AI Forest Fire Detection System ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ² *(In Progress)*

**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Flask, OpenCV, React  
**Start Date:** July 2025

## Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered system to detect forest fires from satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. The goal is to enable early detection and rapid response using automated image classification.

## Objectives

- Design and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect wildfires in satellite images.
- Preprocess and curate a dataset of forest and fire imagery for training and validation.
- Build a Flask API to serve real-time predictions.
- Develop a React-based UI to visualize image input and model output.

## Status

ðŸš§ Currently under development. Updates will be pushed incrementally.

## Future Plans

- Integrate live satellite image feeds.
- Add heatmap visualization for detection confidence.
- Deploy the model on a cloud platform for scalability.
